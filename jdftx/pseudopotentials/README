This directory contains the scripts and source files for
the pseudopotential collection. The actual pseudopotentials
are created / copied / downloaded in the build directory.
Input files should not refer to pseudopotentials that may
exist within this directory in the source tree, and should
instead use the corresponding files in the build directory.
